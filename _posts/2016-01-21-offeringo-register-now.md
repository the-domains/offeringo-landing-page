_How is it any different than Groupon?_

_Contrary to Groupon's business model, Offeringo does not sell any vouchers, instead it has a community of loyal users who would simply claim exclusive offer Coupons from Offeringo._

_How much does it cost?_

_Nothing in the first 6 months of the launch. We are offering a completely free, no obligation promotional offer to a select group of merchants. We will only charge a small subscription fee plus commission each month, should you wish to stay. Prices start from only £10 per month. Please refer to our MerchantAgreement for more details. Subject to T&Cs_

_What categories are there on Offeringo?_

_At the moment we have Restaurants, Cafes, Bakery & Sweets, Hair & Beauty, Spa & Treats, Hotels & Holiday Resorts,Events & Passes and Travel & Commuting._

_Why Offeringo?_

_Because we support our local businesses and wish to help them get their fair share. Some of the leading daily deals platforms take hefty commissions of around 50 to 70%. For e.g. A meal of two advertised normally at £20 could be sold at Groupon for £10 with 50%commission, will leave the merchant with only £5 in Sales. Research shows it only favours the customer and the middleman, with no prospect of repeat sales._

_Offeringo App for iPhone and Android_
